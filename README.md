# STC_TV_Dataset-Analysis
To Analyze STC TV user behavior and provide insights to enhance customer experience 3 tasks:   1.

# STC_TV_Dataset Analysis
This repository contains the code and data for analyzing the STC TV dataset. The dataset contains information about user behavior, such as the programs they watch, the quality they watch them in, and when they watch them.

### 1- Classify and analyze viewers according to the Program Class: A movie or a series.
### 2- Study the different viewing patterns of users and determine the category that watches stc TV in standard definition (SD) versus the category that watches it in high quality (HD). Build an easy and simple model that enables officials to make decisions and make them able to predict the number of expected views of customers during the next two months, and determine possible peak times.
### 3- Build a model to provide recommendations to the user based on the views of other users who share the same preferences, to make the viewing experience on stc TV richer and richer. Show top 5 recommendations for people who watched Moana.
